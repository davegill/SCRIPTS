===============================
NON-NESTED NMM REGRESSION TESTS
===============================

The namelist.input files ending in "b" require binary metgrid input files, which are usually machine-specific.   

The available binary metgrid files are for the bluefire IBM mainframe, which is going away shortly, so we 
don't run these tests right now.
