! This is the new unified namelist, which includes settings for all
! wrf.exe and real_nmm.exe invocations, including 27:9, 27:9:3, ghost,
! analysis, 12hr, and 126hr.  This is accomplished by using the 
! HWRF stream parser to insert environment variables into the namelist.

! These next few lines decide the number of gridpoints in the X and Y
! direction for domains 2 and 3.  These will appear as blank lines in
! the namelist (with a few comment lines).
